Before we define our resources, let's have a look at the **Workload**, which is an **abstraction for developers** to configure things like the location of the source code repository, environment variables and service claims for an application to be delivered through the supply chain.
```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: workload.yaml
text: |2
  apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
  kind: Workload
  metadata:
    labels:
      app.kubernetes.io/part-of: simple-app
      end2end.link/workshop-session: {{ session_namespace }}
    name: simple-app
  spec:
    source:
      git:
        ref:
          branch: main
        url: https://github.com/tsalm-vmware/spring-boot-hello-world.git
```
For the matching of our Workload and Supply Chain we have to set the **label of our ClusterSupplyChain's label selector**. We also defined `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: simple-app` as a label that is required for the commercial Supply Chain Choreographer UI plugin. 
The location of an application's source code can be configured via the `spec.source` field. Here, we are using a branch of a Git repository as a source to be able to implement a **continuous path to production** where every git commit to the codebase will trigger another execution of the Supply Chain, and developers only have to apply a Workload only once if they start with a new application or microservice. 
For the to-be-deployed application, the Workload custom resource also provides configuration options for a **pre-built image in a registry** from e.g. an ISV via `spec.image` and, for a special functionality of the **tanzu CLI**, a **source code container image**, which will be created from source code in a local filesystem and pushed to a registry by the tanzu CLI via `spec.source.image`.

Other configuration options are available for resource constraints (`spec.limits`, `spec.requests`) and environment variables for the build resources in the supply chain (`spec.build.env`) and to be passed to the running application (`spec.env`).

Last but not least via (`.spec.params`), it's possible to override default values of the additional parameters that are used in the Supply Chain but not part of the official Workload specification.
